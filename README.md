## Overview

PlotJuggler is a fast, open-source time-series visualization tool. This repository extends it with drone-specific plugins — primarily targeting MAVLink-based systems such as PX4 and ArduPilot — so that engineers and researchers can stream, inspect, and analyze flight telemetry directly inside PlotJuggler without any extra middleware.

<!-- TODO: Add a screenshot or GIF of the plugin streaming data inside PlotJuggler -->

## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|---|---|
| **DataStreamMavlink** | Streams live MAVLink telemetry over UDP, TCP, or Serial into PlotJuggler. Automatically discovers all message fields and populates them as time-series. Includes a built-in **Message Interval** dialog to inspect and tune per-message update rates on the vehicle. |
| **DataLoadArdupilot** | Loads ArduPilot `.BIN` flight logs directly into PlotJuggler. All numeric fields are automatically available as plot series, with correct units applied. A post-load dialog shows flight **Parameters**, **Embedded Files**, and **Messages** from the log. |

### DataStreamMavlink — Feature Highlights

- **Three transports:** UDP (default port 14550), TCP client, and Serial port — switchable from the connection dialog.
- **Zero-config field discovery:** every numeric field in every MAVLink message is automatically mapped to a plot series named `mav/<sysid>.<compid>/<MSG_NAME>/<field>`.
- **Multi-vehicle:** differentiates streams by `sysid.compid`, so data from multiple vehicles on the same link is kept separate.
- **Message Interval control:** via the **"Message Intervals…"** toolbar action, view live message rates and send `SET_MESSAGE_INTERVAL` commands back to the vehicle to tune what gets streamed and how fast.

### DataLoadArdupilot — Feature Highlights

- **No conversion needed:** open `.BIN` files directly — no pre-processing or format conversion required.
- **All fields, correct units:** every numeric field across all message types is automatically available as a plot series, with units and scaling applied. Optionally append the unit to each series name (e.g. `Roll(deg)`) via a checkbox before loading.
- **Multi-instance sensor support:** sensors with multiple instances (e.g. two GPS units) are kept separate and clearly labelled.
- **Official naming compat:** an optional checkbox matches the series naming convention used by the official ArduPilot PlotJuggler plugin, so saved layouts and scripts work without changes.
- **Post-load info dialog** with three tabs:
  - **Parameters** — all flight parameters from the log, with live search filtering and one-click export to a `.param` file.
  - **Embedded Files** — any files embedded in the log (e.g. crash dumps, config backups), exportable to a folder.
  - **Messages** — all flight messages with timestamps.

## How to Use

### 1. Install PlotJuggler

Download and install the latest PlotJuggler release from the [official GitHub releases page](https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler/releases).

### 2. Download the plugin

Grab the pre-built plugin binary for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/RickyWu18/plotjuggler-drone/releases) page of this repository.

### 3. Drop it into the PlotJuggler plugin folder

Add a custom folder in PlogJuggler Preferences. Or Place the file in the directory where PlotJuggler looks for plugins:

| Platform | Plugin path |
|---|---|
| Windows | Same folder as `plotjuggler.exe` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\PlotJuggler\`) |
| Linux | Same folder as the `plotjuggler` binary (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/`) |


Restart PlotJuggler. The **Plugin** will load in new session.
